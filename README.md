# EarliestDeadlineFirstAlgorithm
EDF algorithm for a reoccurring schedule  

An EDF Algorithm that takes reocurring schedules and also implements a Least Common Multiple class.

From this simple program, I would like to make a program that is for non reocurring schedules and that takes acutal date and times. 
I will write this program by using the boost library. 
A wrapper class around this in such a way that I can create a DLL from the program so I can plug it into a MVC .NET project.
